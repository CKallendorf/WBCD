Machine Learning methods applied to University of Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data Set

This project is the final capstone project of Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree program.
It takes up one supervised binary classification example of the area of cancer research and focuses on the identification of malignant breast tumors based on cytology features from biopsies. 

This project employs a data set of breast tissue biopsies that was collected  by University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison, by Dr. William H. Wolberg from tumor patients during the years of 1989 till 1991, please refer to https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29
