# WBCD: XGBoost models for cancer diagnoses in Wisconsin breast cancer data set

This project is the final capstone project of Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree program.
It takes up one supervised binary classification example of the area of cancer research and focuses on the identification of malignant breast tumors based on cytology features from biopsies. An XGBoost algorithm is used for problem solution; performance will be compared to results from SVM and neural networks. Furthermore, possibilities of feature reduction are investigated based on a PCA model.  

This project employs a data set of breast tissue biopsies that was collected  by University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison, by Dr. William H. Wolberg from tumor patients during the years of 1989 till 1991, please refer to https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29 


# Notes on Software

This project uses the following first-party software libraries: 
- Amazon SageMaker XGBoost framework_version="1.0-1"
- Amazon SageMaker PCA 

Some of the code is adapted to Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree program course material (August 2020).
